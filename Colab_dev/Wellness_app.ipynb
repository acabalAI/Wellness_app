        "the Divine Light. Nothing except the obdurate resistance of the psychic\n",

        "the undivided joy of pure being, there has been self-indulgence of body\n",
        "and mind. These are all real forces, but distorted from their true\n",

        "stimulating to new acts. Thus the mind-image of an indulgence suggests\n",
        "and invites to a new indulgence; the picture of past joy is framed in\n",
        "regrets or hopes. And there is the ceaseless play of the desire to\n",
        "know, to penetrate to the essence of things, to classify. This, too,\n",
        "busies itself ceaselessly with the mind-images. So that we may classify\n",
        "the activities of the psychic nature thus:\n",
        "\n",
        "6. These activities are: Sound intellection, unsound intellection,\n",
        "predication, sleep, memory.\n",
        "We have here a list of mental and emotional powers; of powers that\n",
        "picture and observe, and of powers that picture and feel. But the power\n",
        "to know and feel is spiritual and immortal. What is needed is, not to\n",
        "destroy it, but to raise it from the psychical to the spiritual realm.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The elements of sound intellection are: direct observation,\n",
        "inductive reason, and trustworthy testimony.\n",
        "Each of these is a spiritual power, thinly veiled. Direct observation\n",
        "is the outermost form of the Soul’s pure vision. Inductive reason rests\n",
        "on the great principles of continuity and correspondence; and these, on\n",
        "the supreme truth that all life is of the One. Trustworthy testimony,\n",
        "the sharing of one soul in the wisdom of another, rests on the ultimate\n",
        "oneness of all souls.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Unsound intellection is false understanding, not resting on a\n",
        "perception of the true nature of things.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the object is not truly perceived, when the observation is\n",
        "inaccurate and faulty, thought or reasoning based on that mistaken\n",
        "perception is of necessity false and unsound.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Predication is carried on through words or thoughts not resting on\n",
        "an object perceived.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this Sutra is, to distinguish between the mental process\n",
        "of predication, and observation, induction or testimony. Predication is\n",
        "the attribution of a quality or action to a subject, by adding to it a\n",
        "predicate. In the sentence, “the man is wise,” “the man” is the\n",
        "subject; “is wise” is the predicate. This may be simply an interplay of\n",
        "thoughts, without the presence of the object thought of; or the things\n",
        "thought of may be imaginary or unreal; while observation, induction and\n",
        "testimony always go back to an object.\n",
        "\n",

        "material things being absent.\n",
        "\n",
        "In waking life, we have two currents of perception; an outer current of\n",
        "physical things seen and heard and perceived; an inner current of\n",
        "mind-images and thoughts. The outer current ceases in sleep; the inner\n",
        "current continues, and watching the mind-images float before the field\n",
        "of consciousness, we “dream.” Even when there are no dreams, there is\n",
        "still a certain consciousness in sleep, so that, on waking, one says,\n",
        "“I have slept well,” or “I have slept badly.”\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Memory is holding to mind-images of things perceived, without\n",
        "modifying them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, as before, the mental power is explained in terms of mind-images,\n",
        "which are the material of which the psychic world is built, Therefore\n",
        "the sages teach that the world of our perception, which is indeed a\n",
        "world of mind-images, is but the wraith or shadow of the real and\n",
        "everlasting world. In this sense, memory is but the psychical inversion\n",
        "of the spiritual, ever-present vision. That which is ever before the\n",
        "spiritual eye of the Seer needs not to be remembered.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. The control of these psychic activities comes through the right use\n",
        "of the will, and through ceasing from self-indulgence.\n",
        "\n",
        "If these psychical powers and energies, even such evil things as\n",
        "passion and hate and fear, are but spiritual powers fallen and\n",
        "perverted, how are we to bring about their release and restoration? Two\n",
        "means are presented to us: the awakening of the spiritual will, and the\n",
        "purification of mind and thought.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. The right use of the will is the steady, effort to stand in\n",
        "spiritual being.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have thought of ourselves, perhaps, as creatures moving upon this\n",
        "earth, rather helpless, at the mercy of storm and hunger and our\n",
        "enemies. We are to think of ourselves as immortals, dwelling in the\n",
        "Light, encompassed and sustained by spiritual powers. The steady effort\n",
        "to hold this thought will awaken dormant and unrealized powers, which\n",
        "will unveil to us the nearness of the Eternal.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. This becomes a firm resting-place, when followed long,\n",
        "persistently, with earnestness.\n",
        "\n",
        "We must seek spiritual life in conformity with the laws of spiritual\n",
        "life, with earnestness, humility, gentle charity, which is an\n",
        "acknowledgment of the One Soul within us all. Only through obedience to\n",
        "that shared Life, through perpetual remembrance of our oneness with all\n",
        "Divine Being, our nothingness apart from Divine Being, can we enter our\n",
        "inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Ceasing from self-indulgence is conscious mastery over the thirst\n",
        "for sensuous pleasure here or hereafter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rightly understood, the desire for sensation is the desire of being,\n",
        "the distortion of the soul’s eternal life. The lust of sensual stimulus\n",
        "and excitation rests on the longing to feel one’s life keenly, to gain\n",
        "the sense of being really alive. This sense of true life comes only\n",
        "with the coming of the soul, and the soul comes only in silence, after\n",
        "self-indulgence has been courageously and loyally stilled, through\n",
        "reverence before the coming soul.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. The consummation of this is freedom from thirst for any mode of\n",
        "psychical activity, through the establishment of the spiritual man.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to gain a true understanding of this teaching, study must be\n",
        "supplemented by devoted practice, faith by works. The reading of the\n",
        "words will not avail. There must be a real effort to stand as the Soul,\n",
        "a real ceasing from self-indulgence. With this awakening of the\n",
        "spiritual will, and purification, will come at once the growth of the\n",
        "spiritual man and our awakening consciousness as the spiritual man; and\n",
        "this, attained in even a small degree, will help us notably in our\n",
        "contest. To him that hath, shall be given.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Meditation with an object follows these stages: first, exterior\n",
        "examining, then interior judicial action, then joy, then realization of\n",
        "individual being.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the practice of meditation, a beginning may be made by fixing the\n",
        "attention upon some external object, such as a sacred image or picture,\n",
        "or a part of a book of devotion. In the second stage, one passes from\n",
        "the outer object to an inner pondering upon its lessons. The third\n",
        "stage is the inspiration, the heightening of the spiritual will, which\n",
        "results from this pondering. The fourth stage is the realization of\n",
        "one’s spiritual being, as enkindled by this meditation.\n",
        "\n",

        "very heart of the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "49. The object of this perception is other than what is learned from\n",

        "The distinction is a luminous and inspiring one. The Scriptures teach\n",

        "The first book of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras is called the Book of\n",

        "Book of the Means of Soul Growth. And we must remember that soul growth\n",
        "here means the growth of the realization of the spiritual man, or, to\n",
        "put the matter more briefly, the growth of the spiritual man, and the\n",
        "disentangling of the spiritual man from the wrappings, the veils, the\n",
        "disguises laid upon him by the mind and the psychical nature, wherein\n",
        "he is enmeshed, like a bird caught in a net.\n",
        "\n",
        "The question arises: By what means may the spiritual man be freed from\n",
        "these psychical meshes and disguises, so that he may stand forth above\n",
        "death, in his radiant eternalness and divine power? And the second book\n",
        "sets itself to answer this very question, and to detail the means in a\n",
        "way entirely practical and very lucid, so that he who runs may read,\n",
        "and he who reads may understand and practise.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second part of the second book is concerned with practical\n",
        "spiritual training, that is, with the earlier practical training of the\n",
        "spiritual man.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most striking thing in it is the emphasis laid on the Commandments,\n",
        "which are precisely those of the latter part of the Decalogue, together\n",
        "with obedience to the Master. Our day and generation is far too prone\n",
        "to fancy that there can be mystical life and growth on some other\n",
        "foundation, on the foundation, for example, of intellectual curiosity\n",
        "or psychical selfishness. In reality, on this latter foundation the\n",
        "life of the spiritual man can never be built; nor, indeed, anything but\n",
        "a psychic counterfeit, a dangerous delusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore Patanjali, like every great spiritual teacher, meets the\n",
        "question: What must I do to be saved? with the age-old answer: Keep the\n",
        "Commandments. Only after the disciple can say, These have I kept, can\n",
        "there be the further and finer teaching of the spiritual Rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is, therefore, vital for us to realize that the Yoga system, like\n",
        "every true system of spiritual teaching, rests on this broad and firm\n",
        "foundation of honesty, truth, cleanness, obedience. Without these,\n",
        "there is no salvation; and he who practices these, even though ignorant\n",
        "of spiritual things, is laying up treasure against the time to come.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The practices which make for union with the Soul are: fervent\n",
        "aspiration, spiritual reading, and complete obedience to the Master.\n",
        "\n",
        "The word which I have rendered “fervent aspiration” means primarily\n",
        "“fire”; and, in the Eastern teaching, it means the fire which gives\n",
        "life and light, and at the same time the fire which purifies. We have,\n",
        "therefore, as our first practice, as the first of the means of\n",
        "spiritual growth, that fiery quality of the will which enkindles and\n",
        "illumines, and, at the same time, the steady practice of purification,\n",
        "the burning away of all known impurities. Spiritual reading is so\n",
        "universally accepted and understood, that it needs no comment. The very\n",
        "study of Patanjali’s Sutras is an exercise in spiritual reading, and a\n",
        "very effective one. And so with all other books of the Soul. Obedience\n",
        "to the Master means, that we shall make the will of the Master our\n",
        "will, and shall confirm in all wave to the will of the Divine, setting\n",
        "aside the wills of self, which are but psychic distortions of the one\n",
        "Divine Will. The constant effort to obey in all the ways we know and\n",
        "understand, will reveal new ways and new tasks, the evidence of new\n",
        "growth of the Soul. Nothing will do more for the spiritual man in us\n",
        "than this, for there is no such regenerating power as the awakening\n",
        "spiritual will.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Their aim is, to bring soul-vision, and to wear away hindrances.\n",
        "\n",
        "The aim of fervour, spiritual reading and obedience to the Master, is,\n",
        "to bring soulvision, and to wear away hindrances. Or, to use the phrase\n",
        "we have already adopted, the aim of these practices is, to help the\n",
        "spiritual man to open his eyes; to help him also to throw aside the\n",
        "veils and disguises, the enmeshing psychic nets which surround him,\n",
        "tying his hands, as it were, and bandaging his eyes. And this, as all\n",
        "teachers testify, is a long and arduous task, a steady up-hill fight,\n",
        "demanding fine courage and persistent toil. Fervour, the fire of the\n",
        "spiritual will, is, as we said, two-fold: it illumines, and so helps\n",
        "the spiritual man to see; and it also burns up the nets and meshes\n",
        "which ensnare the spiritual man. So with the other means, spiritual\n",
        "reading and obedience. Each, in its action, is two-fold, wearing away\n",
        "the psychical, and upbuilding the spiritual man.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. These are the hindrances: the darkness of unwisdom, self-assertion,\n",
        "lust hate, attachment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us try to translate this into terms of the psychical and spiritual\n",
        "man. The darkness of unwisdom is, primarily, the self-absorption of the\n",
        "psychical man, his complete preoccupation with his own hopes and fears,\n",
        "plans and purposes, sensations and desires; so that he fails to see, or\n",
        "refuses to see, that there is a spiritual man; and so doggedly resists\n",
        "all efforts of the spiritual man to cast off his psychic tyrant and set\n",
        "himself free. This is the real darkness; and all those who deny the\n",
        "immortality of the soul, or deny the soul’s existence, and so lay out\n",
        "their lives wholly for the psychical, mortal man and his ambitions, are\n",
        "under this power of darkness. Born of this darkness, this psychic\n",
        "self-absorption, is the dogged conviction that the psychic, personal\n",
        "man has separate, exclusive interests, which he can follow for himself\n",
        "alone; and this conviction, when put into practice in our life, leads\n",
        "to contest with other personalities, and so to hate. This hate, again,\n",
        "makes against the spiritual man, since it hinders the revelation of the\n",
        "high harmony between the spiritual man and his other selves, a harmony\n",
        "to be revealed only through the practice of love, that perfect love\n",
        "which casts out fear.\n",
        "\n",
        "In like manner, lust is the psychic man’s craving for the stimulus of\n",
        "sensation, the din of which smothers the voice of the spiritual man,\n",
        "as, in Shakespeare’s phrase, the cackling geese would drown the song of\n",
        "the nightingale. And this craving for stimulus is the fruit of\n",
        "weakness, coming from the failure to find strength in the primal life\n",
        "of the spiritual man.\n",
        "\n",
        "Attachment is but another name for psychic self-absorption; for we are\n",
        "absorbed, not in outward things, but rather in their images within our\n",
        "minds; our inner eyes are fixed on them; our inner desires brood over\n",
        "them; and em we blind ourselves to the presence of the prisoner’ the\n",
        "enmeshed and fettered spiritual man.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The darkness of unwisdom is the field of the others. These\n",
        "hindrances may be dormant, or worn thin, or suspended, or expanded.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we have really two Sutras in one. The first has been explained\n",
        "already: in the darkness of unwisdom grow the parasites, hate, lust,\n",
        "attachment. They are all outgrowths of the self-absorption of the\n",
        "psychical self.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we are told that these barriers may be either dormant, or\n",
        "suspended, or expanded, or worn thin. Faults which are dormant will be\n",
        "brought out through the pressure of life, or through the pressure of\n",
        "strong aspiration. Thus expanded, they must be fought and conquered,\n",
        "or, as Patanjali quaintly says, they must be worn thin,-as a veil\n",
        "might, or the links of manacles.\n",
        "\n",
        "5 The darkness of ignorance is: holding that which is unenduring,\n",
        "impure, full of pain, not the Soul, to be eternal, pure, full of joy,\n",
        "the Soul.\n",
        "\n",
        "This we have really considered already. The psychic man is unenduring,\n",
        "impure, full of pain, not the Soul, not the real Self. The spiritual\n",
        "man is enduring, pure, full of joy, the real Self. The darkness of\n",
        "unwisdom is, therefore, the self-absorption of the psychical, personal\n",
        "man, to the exclusion of the spiritual man. It is the belief, carried\n",
        "into action, that the personal man is the real man, the man for whom we\n",
        "should toil, for whom we should build, for whom we should live. This is\n",
        "that psychical man of whom it is said: he that soweth to the flesh,\n",
        "shall of the flesh reap corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Self-assertion comes from thinking of the Seer and the instrument of\n",
        "vision as forming one self.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the fundamental idea of the Sankhya philosophy, of which the\n",
        "Yoga is avowedly the practical side. To translate this into our terms,\n",
        "we may say that the Seer is the spiritual man; the instrument of vision\n",
        "is the psychical man, through which the spiritual man gains experience\n",
        "of the outer world. But we turn the servant into the master. We\n",
        "attribute to the psychical man, the personal self, a reality which\n",
        "really belongs to the spiritual man alone; and so, thinking of the\n",
        "quality of the spiritual man as belonging to the psychical, we merge\n",
        "the spiritual man in the psychical; or, as the text says, we think of\n",
        "the two as forming one self.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Lust is the resting in the sense of enjoyment.\n",
        "\n",
        "This has been explained again and again. Sensation, as, for example,\n",
        "the sense of taste, is meant to be the guide to action; in this case,\n",
        "the choice of wholesome food, and the avoidance of poisonous and\n",
        "hurtful things. But if we rest in the sense of taste, as a pleasure in\n",
        "itself; rest, that is, in the psychical side of taste, we fall into\n",
        "gluttony, and live to eat, instead of eating to live. So with the other\n",
        "great organic power, the power of reproduction. This lust comes into\n",
        "being, through resting in the sensation, and looking for pleasure from\n",
        "that.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Hate is the resting in the sense of pain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pain comes, for the most part, from the strife of personalities, the\n",
        "jarring discords between psychic selves, each of which deems itself\n",
        "supreme. A dwelling on this pain breeds hate, which tears the warring\n",
        "selves yet further asunder, and puts new enmity between them, thus\n",
        "hindering the harmony of the Real, the reconciliation through the Soul.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Attachment is the desire toward life, even in the wise, carried\n",
        "forward by its own energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The life here desired is the psychic life, the intensely vibrating life\n",
        "of the psychical self. This prevails even in those who have attained\n",
        "much wisdom, so long as it falls short of the wisdom of complete\n",
        "renunciation, complete obedience to each least behest of the spiritual\n",
        "man, and of the Master who guards and aids the spiritual man.\n",
        "\n",
        "The desire of sensation, the desire of psychic life, reproduces itself,\n",
        "carried on by its own energy and momentum; and hence comes the circle\n",
        "of death and rebirth, death and rebirth, instead of the liberation of\n",
        "the spiritual man.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. These hindrances, when they have become subtle, are to be removed\n",
        "by a countercurrent.\n",
        "\n",
        "The darkness of unwisdom is to be removed by the light of wisdom,\n",
        "pursued through fervour, spiritual reading of holy teachings and of\n",
        "life itself, and by obedience to the Master.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lust is to be removed by pure aspiration of spiritual life, which,\n",
        "bringing true strength and stability, takes away the void of weakness\n",
        "which we try to fill by the stimulus of sensations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hate is to be overcome by love. The fear that arises through the sense\n",
        "of separate, warring selves is to be stilled by the realization of the\n",
        "One Self, the one soul in all. This realization is the perfect love\n",
        "that casts out fear.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hindrances are said to have become subtle when, by initial efforts,\n",
        "they have been located and recognized in the psychic nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Their active turnings are to be removed by meditation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is, in truth, the whole secret of Yoga, the science of the soul.\n",
        "The active turnings, the strident vibrations, of selfishness, lust and\n",
        "hate are to be stilled by meditation, by letting heart and mind dwell\n",
        "in spiritual life, by lifting up the heart to the strong, silent life\n",
        "above, which rests in the stillness of eternal love, and needs no harsh\n",
        "vibration to convince it of true being.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. The burden of bondage to sorrow has its root in these hindrances.\n",
        "It will be felt in this life, or in a life not yet manifested.\n",
        "\n",
        "The burden of bondage to sorrow has its root in the darkness of\n",
        "unwisdom, in selfishness, in lust, in hate, in attachment to sensation.\n",
        "All these are, in the last analysis, absorption in the psychical self;\n",
        "and this means sorrow, because it means the sense of separateness, and\n",
        "this means jarring discord and inevitable death. But the psychical self\n",
        "will breed a new psychical self, in a new birth, and so new sorrows in\n",
        "a life not yet manifest.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. From this root there grow and ripen the fruits of birth, of the\n",
        "life-span, of all that is tasted in life.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fully to comment on this, would be to write a treatise on Karma and its\n",
        "practical working in detail, whereby the place and time of the next\n",
        "birth, its content and duration, are determined; and to do this the\n",
        "present commentator is in no wise fitted. But this much is clearly\n",
        "understood: that, through a kind of spiritual gravitation, the\n",
        "incarnating self is drawn to a home and life-circle which will give it\n",
        "scope and discipline; and its need of discipline is clearly conditioned\n",
        "by its character, its standing, its accomplishment.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. These bear fruits of rejoicing, or of affliction, as they are\n",
        "sprung from holy or unholy works.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since holiness is obedience to divine law, to the law of divine\n",
        "harmony, and obedience to harmony strengthens that harmony in the soul,\n",
        "which is the one true joy, therefore joy comes of holiness: comes,\n",
        "indeed, in no other way. And as unholiness is disobedience, and\n",
        "therefore discord, therefore unholiness makes for pain; and this\n",
        "two-fold law is true, whether the cause take effect in this, or in a\n",
        "yet unmanifested birth.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. To him who possesses discernment, all personal life is misery,\n",
        "because it ever waxes and wanes, is ever afflicted with restlessness,\n",
        "makes ever new dynamic impresses in the mind; and because all its\n",
        "activities war with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "The whole life of the psychic self is misery, because it ever waxes and\n",
        "wanes; because birth brings inevitable death; because there is no\n",
        "expectation without its shadow, fear. The life of the psychic self is\n",
        "misery, because it is afflicted with restlessness; so that he who has\n",
        "much, finds not satisfaction, but rather the whetted hunger for more.\n",
        "The fire is not quenched by pouring oil on it; so desire is not\n",
        "quenched by the satisfaction of desire. Again, the life of the psychic\n",
        "self is misery, because it makes ever new dynamic impresses in the\n",
        "mind; because a desire satisfied is but the seed from which springs the\n",
        "desire to find like satisfaction again. The appetite comes in eating,\n",
        "as the proverb says, and grows by what it feeds on. And the psychic\n",
        "self, torn with conflicting desires, is ever the house divided against\n",
        "itself, which must surely fall.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. This pain is to be warded off, before it has come.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, we cannot cure the pains of life by laying on them any\n",
        "balm. We must cut the root, absorption in the psychical self. So it is\n",
        "said, there is no cure for the misery of longing, but to fix the heart\n",
        "upon the eternal.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. The cause of what is to be warded off, is the absorption of the\n",
        "Seer in things seen.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here again we have the fundamental idea of the Sankhya, which is the\n",
        "intellectual counterpart of the Yoga system. The cause of what is to be\n",
        "warded off, the root of misery, is the absorption of consciousness in\n",
        "the psychical man and the things which beguile the psychical man. The\n",
        "cure is liberation.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. Things seen have as their property manifestation, action, inertia.\n",

        "The third book of the Sutras is the Book of Spiritual Powers. In\n",

        "kept in memory. The first of these is this: These spiritual powers can\n",
        "only be gained when the development described in the first and second\n",
        "books has been measurably attained; when the Commandments have been\n",
        "kept, the Rules faithfully followed, and the experiences which are\n",
        "described have been passed through. For only after this is the\n",
        "spiritual man so far grown, so far disentangled from the psychical\n",
        "bandages and veils which have confined and blinded him, that he can use\n",
        "his proper powers and faculties. For this is the secret of all\n",
        "spiritual powers: they are in no sense an abnormal or supernatural\n",
        "overgrowth upon the material man, but are rather the powers and\n",
        "faculties inherent in the spiritual man, entirely natural to him, and\n",
        "coming naturally into activity, as the spiritual man is disentangled\n",
        "and liberated from psychical bondage, through keeping the Commandments\n",
        "and Rules already set forth.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the personal man is the limitation and inversion of the spiritual\n",
        "man, all his faculties and powers are inversions of the powers of the\n",
        "spiritual man. In a single phrase, his self seeking is the inversion of\n",
        "the Self-seeking which is the very being of the spiritual man: the\n",
        "ceaseless search after the divine and august Self of all beings. This\n",
        "inversion is corrected by keeping the Commandments and Rules, and\n",
        "gradually, as the inversion is overcome, the spiritual man is\n",
        "extricated, and comes into possession and free exercise of his powers.\n",
        "The spiritual powers, therefore, are the powers of the grown and\n",
        "liberated spiritual man. They can only be developed and used as the\n",
        "spiritual man grows and attains liberation through obedience. This is\n",
        "the first thing to be kept in mind, in all that is said of spiritual\n",
        "powers in the third and fourth books of the Sutras. The second thing to\n",
        "be understood and kept in mind is this:\n",
        "\n",
        "Just as our modern sages have discerned and taught that all matter is\n",
        "ultimately one and eternal, definitely related throughout the whole\n",
        "wide universe; just as they have discerned and taught that all force is\n",
        "one and eternal, so coordinated throughout the whole universe that\n",
        "whatever affects any atom measurably affects the whole boundless realm\n",
        "of matter and force, to the most distant star or nebula on the dim\n",
        "confines of space; so the ancient sages had discerned and taught that\n",
        "all consciousness is one, immortal, indivisible, infinite; so finely\n",
        "correlated and continuous that whatever is perceived by any\n",
        "consciousness is, whether actually or potentially, within the reach of\n",
        "all consciousness, and therefore within the reach of any consciousness.\n",
        "This has been well expressed by saying that all souls are fundamentally\n",
        "one with the Oversoul; that the Son of God, and all Sons of God, are\n",
        "fundamentally one with the Father. When the consciousness is cleared of\n",
        "psychic bonds and veils, when the spiritual man is able to stand, to\n",
        "see, then this superb law comes into effect: whatever is within the\n",
        "knowledge of any consciousness, and this includes the whole infinite\n",
        "universe, is within his reach, and may, if he wills, be made a part of\n",
        "his consciousness. This he may attain through his fundamental unity\n",
        "with the Oversoul, by raising himself toward the consciousness above\n",
        "him, and drawing on its resources. The Son, if he would work miracles,\n",
        "whether of perception or of action, must come often into the presence\n",
        "of the Father. This is the birthright of the spiritual man; through it\n",

        "reading, and easily take in its meaning. The act of will, the effort of\n",
        "attention, the intending of the mind on each word and line of the page,\n",
        "just as the eyes are focussed on each word and line, is the power here\n",

        "in all knowledge. Attention to spiritual things is the first step to\n",
        "spiritual knowledge.\n",

        "is meditation (dhyana).\n",
        "\n",
        "This will apply equally to outer and inner things. I may for a moment\n",

        "glance, or I may hold the attention fixedly on it until it reveals far\n",
        "more of its nature than a single glance could perceive. The first is\n",
        "the focussing of the searchlight of consciousness upon the object. The\n",
        "other is the holding of the white beam of light steadily and\n",
        "persistently on the object, until it yields up the secret of its\n",
        "details. So for things within; one may fix the inner glance for a\n",
        "moment on spiritual things, or one may hold the consciousness steadily\n",
        "upon them, until what was in the dark slowly comes forth into the\n",
        "light, and yields up its immortal secret. But this is possible only for\n",
        "the spiritual man, after the Commandments and the Rules have been kept;\n",

        "contemplation (samadhi).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us review the steps so far taken. First, the beam of perceiving\n",
        "consciousness is focussed on a certain region or subject, through the\n",
        "effort of attention. Then this attending consciousness is held on its\n",
        "object. Third, there is the ardent will to know its meaning, to\n",

        "desire merely to indorse a previous opinion and so prove oneself right,\n",
        "and all desire for personal profit or gratification must be quite put\n",
        "away. There must be a purely disinterested love of truth for its own\n",
        "sake. Thus is the perceiving consciousness made void, as it were, of\n",
        "all personality or sense of separateness. The personal limitation\n",

        "with pure light.\n",

        "4. When these three, Attention, Meditation Contemplation, are exercised\n",
        "at once, this is perfectly concentrated Meditation (sanyama).\n",
        "\n",
        "When the personal limitation of the perceiving consciousness stands\n",
        "aside, and allows the All-conscious to come to bear upon the problem,\n",
        "then arises that real knowledge which is called a flash of genius; that\n",
        "real knowledge which makes discoveries, and without which no discovery\n",
        "can be made, however painstaking the effort. For genius is the vision\n",
        "of the spiritual man, and that vision is a question of growth rather\n",
        "than present effort; though right effort, rightly continued, will in\n",
        "time infallibly lead to growth and vision. Through the power thus to\n",
        "set aside personal limitation, to push aside petty concerns and cares,\n",
        "and steady the whole nature and will in an ardent love of truth and\n",
        "desire to know it; through the power thus to make way for the\n",
        "All-consciousness, all great men make their discoveries. Newton,\n",
        "watching the apple fall to the earth, was able to look beyond, to see\n",
        "the subtle waves of force pulsating through apples and worlds and suns\n",
        "and galaxies, and thus to perceive universal gravitation. The Oversoul,\n",
        "looking through his eyes, recognized the universal force, one of its\n",
        "own children. Darwin, watching the forms and motions of plants and\n",
        "animals, let the same august consciousness come to bear on them, and\n",
        "saw infinite growth perfected through ceaseless struggle. He perceived\n",
        "the superb process of evolution, the Oversoul once more recognizing its\n",
        "own. Fraunhofer, noting the dark lines in the band of sunlight in his\n",
        "spectroscope, divined their identity with the bright lines in the\n",
        "spectra of incandescent iron, sodium and the rest, and so saw the\n",
        "oneness of substance in the worlds and suns, the unity of the materials\n",
        "of the universe. Once again the Oversoul, looking with his eyes,\n",
        "recognized its own. So it is with all true knowledge. But the mind must\n",
        "transcend its limitations, its idiosyncrasies; there must be purity,\n",
        "for to the pure in heart is the promise, that they shall see God.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. By mastering this perfectly concentrated Meditation, there comes the\n",
        "illumination of perception.\n",
        "\n",
        "The meaning of this is illustrated by what has been said before. When\n",
        "the spiritual man is able to throw aside the trammels of emotional and\n",
        "mental limitation, and to open his eyes, he sees clearly, he attains to\n",
        "illuminated perception. A poet once said that Occultism is the\n",
        "conscious cultivation of genius; and it is certain that the awakened\n",
        "spiritual man attains to the perceptions of genius. Genius is the\n",
        "vision, the power, of the spiritual man, whether its possessor\n",
        "recognizes this or not. All true knowledge is of the spiritual man. The\n",
        "greatest in all ages have recognized this and put their testimony on\n",
        "record. The great in wisdom who have not consciously recognized it,\n",
        "have ever been full of the spirit of reverence, of selfless devotion to\n",
        "truth, of humility, as was Darwin; and reverence and humility are the\n",
        "unconscious recognition of the nearness of the Spirit, that Divinity\n",
        "which broods over us, a Master o’er a slave.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. This power is distributed in ascending degrees.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is to be attained step by step. It is a question, not of miracle,\n",
        "but of evolution, of growth. Newton had to master the multiplication\n",
        "table, then the four rules of arithmetic, then the rudiments of\n",
        "algebra, before he came to the binomial theorem. At each point, there\n",
        "was attention, concentration, insight; until these were attained, no\n",
        "progress to the next point was possible. So with Darwin. He had to\n",
        "learn the form and use of leaf and flower, of bone and muscle; the\n",
        "characteristics of genera and species; the distribution of plants and\n",
        "animals, before he had in mind that nexus of knowledge on which the\n",
        "light of his great idea was at last able to shine. So is it with all\n",
        "knowledge. So is it with spiritual knowledge. Take the matter this way:\n",
        "The first subject for the exercise of my spiritual insight is my day,\n",
        "with its circumstances, its hindrances, its opportunities, its duties.\n",
        "I do what I can to solve it, to fulfil its duties, to learn its\n",
        "lessons. I try to live my day with aspiration and faith. That is the\n",
        "first step. By doing this, I gather a harvest for the evening, I gain a\n",
        "deeper insight into life, in virtue of which I begin the next day with\n",
        "a certain advantage, a certain spiritual advance and attainment. So\n",
        "with all successive days. In faith and aspiration, we pass from day to\n",
        "day, in growing knowledge and power, with never more than one day to\n",
        "solve at a time, until all life becomes radiant and transparent.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. This threefold power, of Attention, Meditation, Contemplation, is\n",
        "more interior than the means of growth previously described.\n",
        "\n",
        "Very naturally so; because the means of growth previously described\n",
        "were concerned with the extrication of the spiritual man from psychic\n",
        "bondages and veils; while this threefold power is to be exercised by\n",
        "the spiritual man thus extricated and standing on his feet, viewing\n",
        "life with open eyes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. But this triad is still exterior to the soul vision which is\n",
        "unconditioned, free from the seed of mental analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason is this: The threefold power we have been considering, the\n",
        "triad of Attention, Contemplation, Meditation is, so far as we have yet\n",
        "considered it, the focussing of the beam of perceiving consciousness\n",
        "upon some form of manifesting being, with a view of understanding it\n",
        "completely. There is a higher stage, where the beam of consciousness is\n",
        "turned back upon itself, and the individual consciousness enters into,\n",
        "and knows, the All consciousness. This is a being, a being in\n",
        "immortality, rather than a knowing; it is free from mental analysis or\n",
        "mental forms. It is not an activity of the higher mind, even the mind\n",
        "of the spiritual man. It is an activity of the soul. Had Newton risen\n",
        "to this higher stage, he would have known, not the laws of motion, but\n",
        "that high Being, from whose Life comes eternal motion. Had Darwin risen\n",
        "to this, he would have seen the Soul, whose graduated thought and being\n",
        "all evolution expresses. There are, therefore, these two perceptions:\n",
        "that of living things, and that of the Life; that of the Soul’s works,\n",
        "and that of the Soul itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. One of the ascending degrees is the development of Control. First\n",
        "there is the overcoming of the mind-impress of excitation. Then comes\n",
        "the manifestation of the mind-impress of Control. Then the perceiving\n",
        "consciousness follows after the moment of Control.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the development of Control. The meaning seems to be this: Some\n",
        "object enters the field of observation, and at first violently excites\n",
        "the mind, stirring up curiosity, fear, wonder; then the consciousness\n",
        "returns upon itself, as it were, and takes the perception firmly in\n",
        "hand, steadying itself, and viewing the matter calmly from above. This\n",
        "steadying effort of the will upon the perceiving consciousness is\n",
        "Control, and immediately upon it follows perception, understanding,\n",
        "insight.\n",
        "\n",
        "Take a trite example. Supposing one is walking in an Indian forest. A\n",
        "charging elephant suddenly appears. The man is excited by astonishment,\n",
        "and, perhaps, terror. But he exercises an effort of will, perceives the\n",
        "situation in its true bearings, and recognizes that a certain thing\n",
        "must be done; in this case, probably, that he must get out of the way\n",
        "as quickly as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or a comet, unheralded, appears in the sky like a flaming sword. The\n",
        "beholder is at first astonished, perhaps terror-stricken; but he takes\n",
        "himself in hand, controls his thoughts, views the apparition calmly,\n",
        "and finally calculates its orbit and its relation to meteor showers.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are extreme illustrations; but with all knowledge the order of\n",
        "perception is the same: first, the excitation of the mind by the new\n",
        "object impressed on it; then the control of the mind from within; upon\n",
        "which follows the perception of the nature of the object. Where the\n",
        "eyes of the spiritual man are open, this will be a true and penetrating\n",
        "spiritual perception. In some such way do our living experiences come\n",
        "to us; first, with a shock of pain; then the Soul steadies itself and\n",
        "controls the pain; then the spirit perceives the lesson of the event,\n",
        "and its bearing upon the progressive revelation of life.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Through frequent repetition of this process, the mind becomes\n",
        "habituated to it, and there arises an equable flow of perceiving\n",
        "consciousness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Control of the mind by the Soul, like control of the muscles by the\n",
        "mind, comes by practice, and constant voluntary repetition.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an example of control of the muscles by the mind, take the ceaseless\n",
        "practice by which a musician gains mastery over his instrument, or a\n",
        "fencer gains skill with a rapier. Innumerable small efforts of\n",
        "attention will make a result which seems well-nigh miraculous; which,\n",
        "for the novice, is really miraculous. Then consider that far more\n",
        "wonderful instrument, the perceiving mind, played on by that fine\n",
        "musician, the Soul. Here again, innumerable small efforts of attention\n",
        "will accumulate into mastery, and a mastery worth winning. For a\n",
        "concrete example, take the gradual conquest of each day, the effort to\n",
        "live that day for the Soul. To him that is faithful unto death, the\n",
        "Master gives the crown of life.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. The gradual conquest of the mind’s tendency to flit from one object\n",
        "to another, and the power of one-pointedness, make the development of\n",
        "Contemplation.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an illustration of the mind’s tendency to flit from one object to\n",
        "another, take a small boy, learning arithmetic. He begins: two ones are\n",
        "two; three ones are three-and then he thinks of three coins in his\n",
        "pocket, which will purchase so much candy, in the store down the\n",
        "street, next to the toy-shop, where are base-balls, marbles and so\n",
        "on,—and then he comes back with a jerk, to four ones are four. So with\n",
        "us also. We are seeking the meaning of our task, but the mind takes\n",
        "advantage of a moment of slackened attention, and flits off from one\n",
        "frivolous detail to another, till we suddenly come back to\n",
        "consciousness after traversing leagues of space. We must learn to\n",
        "conquer this, and to go back within ourselves into the beam of\n",
        "perceiving consciousness itself, which is a beam of the Oversoul. This\n",
        "is the true onepointedness, the bringing of our consciousness to a\n",
        "focus in the Soul.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. When, following this, the controlled manifold tendency and the\n",
        "aroused one-pointedness are equally balanced parts of the perceiving\n",
        "consciousness, his the development of one-pointedness.\n",
        "\n",
        "This would seem to mean that the insight which is called\n",
        "one-pointedness has two sides, equally balanced. There is, first, the\n",
        "manifold aspect of any object, the sum of all its characteristics and\n",
        "properties. This is to be held firmly in the mind. Then there is the\n",
        "perception of the object as a unity, as a whole, the perception of its\n",
        "essence. First, the details must be clearly perceived; then the essence\n",
        "must be comprehended. When the two processes are equally balanced, the\n",
        "true onepointedness is attained. Everything has these two sides, the\n",
        "side of difference and the side of unity; there is the individual and\n",
        "there is the genus; the pole of matter and diversity, and the pole of\n",
        "oneness and spirit. To see the object truly, we must see both.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Through this, the inherent character, distinctive marks and\n",
        "conditions of being and powers, according to their development, are\n",
        "made clear.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the power defined in the preceding sutra, the inherent character,\n",
        "distinctive marks and conditions of beings and powers are made clear.\n",
        "For through this power, as defined, we get a twofold view of each\n",
        "object, seeing at once all its individual characteristics and its\n",
        "essential character, species and genus; we see it in relation to\n",
        "itself, and in relation to the Eternal. Thus we see a rose as that\n",
        "particular flower, with its colour and scent, its peculiar fold of each\n",
        "petal; but we also see in it the species, the family to which it\n",
        "belongs, with its relation to all plants, to all life, to Life itself.\n",
        "So in any day, we see events and circumstances; we also see in it the\n",
        "lesson set for the soul by the Eternal.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Every object has its characteristics which are already quiescent,\n",
        "those which are active, and those which are not yet definable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Every object has characteristics belonging to its past, its present and\n",
        "its future. In a fir tree, for example, there are the stumps or scars\n",
        "of dead branches, which once represented its foremost growth; there are\n",
        "the branches with their needles spread out to the air; there are the\n",
        "buds at the end of each branch and twig, which carry the still closely\n",
        "packed needles which are the promise of the future. In like manner, the\n",
        "chrysalis has, as its past, the caterpillar; as its future, the\n",
        "butterfly. The man has, in his past, the animal; in his future, the\n",
        "angel. Both are visible even now in his face. So with all things, for\n",
        "all things change and grow.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Difference in stage is the cause of difference in development.\n",
        "\n",
        "This but amplifies what has just been said. The first stage is the\n",
        "sapling, the caterpillar, the animal. The second stage is the growing\n",
        "tree, the chrysalis, the man. The third is the splendid pine, the\n",
        "butterfly, the angel. Difference of stage is the cause of difference of\n",
        "development. So it is among men, and among the races of men.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Through perfectly concentrated Meditation on the three stages of\n",
        "development comes a knowledge of past and future.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have taken our illustrations from natural science, because, since\n",
        "every true discovery in natural science is a divination of a law in\n",
        "nature, attained through a flash of genius, such discoveries really\n",
        "represent acts of spiritual perception, acts of perception by the\n",
        "spiritual man, even though they are generally not so recognized. So we\n",
        "may once more use the same illustration. Perfectly concentrated\n",
        "Meditation, perfect insight into the chrysalis, reveals the caterpillar\n",
        "that it has been, the butterfly that it is destined to be. He who knows\n",
        "the seed, knows the seed-pod or ear it has come from, and the plant\n",
        "that is to come from it. So in like manner he who really knows today,\n",
        "and the heart of to-day, knows its parent yesterday and its child\n",
        "tomorrow. Past, present and future are all in the Eternal. He who\n",
        "dwells in the Eternal knows all three.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. The sound and the object and the thought called up by a word are\n",
        "confounded because they are all blurred together in the mind. By\n",
        "perfectly concentrated Meditation on the distinction between them,\n",
        "there comes an understanding of the sounds uttered by all beings.\n",
        "\n",
        "It must be remembered that we are speaking of perception by the\n",
        "spiritual man.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sound, like every force, is the expression of a power of the Eternal.\n",
        "Infinite shades of this power are expressed in the infinitely varied\n",
        "tones of sound. He who, having entry to the consciousness of the\n",
        "Eternal knows the essence of this power, can divine the meanings of all\n",
        "sounds, from the voice of the insect to the music of the spheres.\n",
        "\n",
        "In like manner, he who has attained to spiritual vision can perceive\n",
        "the mind-images in the thoughts of others, with the shade of feeling\n",
        "which goes with them, thus reading their thoughts as easily as he hears\n",
        "their words. Every one has the germ of this power, since difference of\n",
        "tone will give widely differing meanings to the same words, meanings\n",
        "which are intuitively perceived by everyone.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. When the mind-impressions become visible, there comes an\n",
        "understanding of previous births.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is simple enough if we grasp the truth of rebirth. The fine\n",
        "harvest of past experiences is drawn into the spiritual nature,\n",
        "forming, indeed, the basis of its development. When the consciousness\n",
        "has been raised to a point above these fine subjective impressions, and\n",
        "can look down upon them from above, this will in itself be a\n",
        "remembering of past births.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on mind-images is gained the\n",
        "understanding of the thoughts of others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, for those who can profit by it, is the secret of thought-reading.\n",
        "Take the simplest case of intentional thought transference. It is the\n",
        "testimony of those who have done this, that the perceiving mind must be\n",
        "stilled, before the mind-image projected by the other mind can be seen.\n",
        "With it comes a sense of the feeling and temper of the other mind and\n",
        "so on, in higher degrees.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. But since that on which the thought in the mind of another rests is\n",
        "not objective to the thought-reader’s consciousness, he perceives the\n",
        "thought only, and not also that on which the thought rests.\n",
        "\n",
        "The meaning appears to be simple: One may be able to perceive the\n",
        "thoughts of some one at a distance; one cannot, by that means alone,\n",
        "also perceive the external surroundings of that person, which arouse\n",
        "these thoughts.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the form of the body, by\n",
        "arresting the body’s perceptibility, and by inhibiting the eye’s power\n",
        "of sight, there comes the power to make the body invisible.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many instances of the exercise of this power, by mesmerists,\n",
        "hypnotists and the like; and we may simply call it an instance of the\n",
        "power of suggestion. Shankara tells us that by this power the popular\n",
        "magicians of the East perform their wonders, working on the mind-images\n",
        "of others, while remaining invisible themselves. It is all a question\n",
        "of being able to see and control the mind-images.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. The works which fill out the life-span may be either immediately or\n",
        "gradually operative. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on these\n",
        "comes a knowledge of the time of the end, as also through signs.\n",
        "\n",
        "A garment which is wet, says the commentator, may be hung up to dry,\n",
        "and so dry rapidly, or it may be rolled in a ball and dry slowly; so a\n",
        "fire may blaze or smoulder. Thus it is with Karma, the works that fill\n",
        "out the life-span. By an insight into the mental forms and forces which\n",

              "'Therefore Patanjali, like every great spiritual teacher, meets the question: What must I do to be saved? with the age-old answer: Keep the Commandments. Only after the disciple can say, These have I kept, can there be the further and finer teaching of the spiritual Rules. Let no one imagine that the true life, the true powers of the spiritual man, can be attained by any way except the hard way of sacrifice, of trial, of renunciation, of selfless self-conquest and genuine devotion to the weal of all others. Only thus can the golden gates be reached and entered. Only thus can we attain to that pure world wherein the spiritual man lives, and moves, and has his being. Nothing impure, nothing unholy can ever cross that threshold, least of all impure motives or self seeking desires. These must be burnt away before an entrance to that world can be gained. Therefore ponder well the earlier rules, and lay a firm foundation of courage, sacrifice, selflessness, holiness. The darkness of unwisdom is the field of the others. These hindrances may be dormant, or worn thin, or suspended, or expanded. Here we have really two Sutras in one. The first has been explained already: in the darkness of unwisdom grow the parasites, hate, lust, attachment. They are all outgrowths of the self-absorption of the psychical self. Next, we are told that these barriers may be either dormant, or suspended, or expanded, or worn thin. Faults which are dormant will be brought out through the pressure of life, or through the pressure of strong aspiration. Thus expanded, they must be fought and conquered, or, as Patanjali quaintly says, they must be worn thin,-as a veil might, or the links of manacles. 5 The darkness of ignorance is: holding that which is unenduring, impure, full of pain, not the Soul, to be eternal, pure, full of joy, the Soul. This we have really considered already. The psychic man is unenduring, impure, full of pain, not the Soul, not the real Self. The spiritual man is enduring, pure, full of joy, the real Self. The darkness of unwisdom is, therefore, the self-absorption of the psychical, personal man, to the exclusion of the spiritual man. It is the belief, carried into action, that the personal man is the real man, the man for whom we should toil, for whom we should build, for whom we should live. This is that psychical man of whom it is said: he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption. 6.'"

            "Context It is, therefore, vital for us to realize that the Yoga system, like every true system of spiritual teaching, rests on this broad and firm foundation of honesty, truth, cleanness, obedience. Without these, there is no salvation; and he who practices these, even though ignorant of spiritual things, is laying up treasure against the time to come. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are in themselves exceedingly brief, less than ten pages of large type in the original. Yet they contain the essence of practical wisdom, set forth in admirable order and detail. The theme, if the present interpreter be right, is the great regeneration, the birth of the spiritual from the psychical man: the same theme which Paul so wisely and eloquently set forth in writing to his disciples in Corinth, the theme of all mystics in all lands. The first book of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras is called the Book of Spiritual Consciousness. The second book, which we now begin, is the Book of the Means of Soul Growth. And we must remember that soul growth here means the growth of the realization of the spiritual man, or, to put the matter more briefly, the growth of the spiritual man, and the disentangling of the spiritual man from the wrappings, the veils, the disguises laid upon him by the mind and the psychical nature, wherein he is enmeshed, like a bird caught in a net. The eight means of Yoga are: the Commandments, the Rules, right Poise, right Control of the life-force, Withdrawal, Attention, Meditation, Contemplation. These eight means are to be followed in their order, in the sense which will immediately be made clear. We can get a ready understanding of the first two by comparing them with the Commandments which must be obeyed by all good citizens, and the Rules which are laid on the members of religious orders. Until one has fulfilled the first, it is futile to concern oneself with the second. And so with all the means of Yoga. They must be taken in their order. 30. From steadfastly following after the means of Yoga, until impurity is worn away, there comes the illumination of thought up to full discernment. Here, we enter on the more detailed practical teaching of Patanjali, with its sound and luminous good sense. And when we come to detail the means of Yoga, we may well be astonished at their simplicity. There is little in them that is mysterious. They are very familiar. The essence of the matter lies in carrying them out. 29.\n"

Only after the disciple can say, These have I kept, can there be the further and finer teaching of the spiritual Rules. Let no one imagine that the true life, the true powers of the spiritual man, can be attained by any way except the hard way of sacrifice, of trial, of renunciation, of selfless self-conquest and genuine devotion to the weal of all others. Only thus can the golden gates be reached and entered. Only thus can we attain to that pure world wherein the spiritual man lives, and moves, and has his being. Nothing impure, nothing unholy can ever cross that threshold, least of all impure motives or self seeking desires. These must be burnt away before an entrance to that world can be gained. Therefore ponder well the earlier rules, and lay a firm foundation of courage, sacrifice, selflessness, holiness.\n",
